           Ecology of Leatherback Sea Turtles

            Habitat
        </h2>
        <p>
            Leatherback sea turtles primarily live in the open ocean. They can be found in all tropical and subtropical oceans, with a range extending well into the Arctic Circle. They often follow their prey, diving deep into frigid waters and returning to the surface to regain warmth. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Feeding
        </h2>
        <p>
            Adult leatherback sea turtles feed primarily on jellyfish, supplementing their diets with other soft bodied organisms like cnidarians, tunicates, and cephalopods.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Threats
        </h2>
        <p>
            Leatherback sea turtles are currently listed as endangered.
        </p>
        <p>
            A major threat to leatherback sea turtles is marine debris. It is estimated that one-third of adult leatherbacks have ingested plastic, often in the form of plastic bags that mimic their prey, jellyfish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other threats to the species include light pollution, bycatch, boat strikes, and chemical pollution.
