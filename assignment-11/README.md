Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.

It is important to have fallback fonts or a font stack to ensure that your text style will be at least somewhat visible visible on different devices that have varying fonts installed. 

A system font is a font installed on the user's computer. A web font, alternatively, is not installed on the user's computer and instead hosted on a server. A web-safe font is one that is pre-installed by most operating systems, so a developer can assume the user has the font downloaded, reducing load times.
