My user testing went well overall. I felt comfortable letting my users explore the my website and guiding them when needed. My users generally had positive experiences, which was relieving since I've tried to take user experience into account when designing my website.
My biggest lesson from user testing was that it didn't make sense to have the about page as the home page, and I instead needed a dedicated, separate home page. User testing also revealed a few places where I had mistakes I had missed. I added a new page that would better serve as a home page, and fixed the small errors that the users uncovered.
